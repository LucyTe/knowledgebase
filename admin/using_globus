## Potential issues
### Non-standard characters in filenames
- files whose names contain non-alphanumeric characters (eg. ; ? =) may be rejected by windows machines during transfer
### Changes in files on host or client
- due to Globus monitoring for file integrity, changes that are made to files or directories on either side during transfer can interrupt the transfer
