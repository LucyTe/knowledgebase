Code and sample metadata and data for running simulation based power calculations can be found [here](https://github.com/hbc/power_calc_simulations). 
This code will use the mean and variance of the data set to derive simulated datasets with a defined number of values with defined fold changes. The simulated data will the be tested to determine precision and recall estimates for the comparison.
